# A-Level School Project, School News Website

This repo contains the code for my A-level school project. It is a react/express application for a school news website.

## How to run

To run, first install dependencies in frontend and server

```
cd server
npm i
```

In another terminal

```
cd frontend
npm i
```

Once dependencies have installed, run npm start in both the server and frontend terminal

```
npm start
```
